2. Automated Web Scraper with Scheduler
🔍 What is it?

It’s a script that automatically scrapes data (like product info, headlines, etc.) from a website and stores it. You can also schedule it to run every day or at specific intervals.

⚙️ How does it work?

The script uses Selenium (for dynamic websites) or requests + BeautifulSoup (for static ones) to load and read webpage data.
It extracts relevant data from the HTML using tags and attributes.
The data is saved in CSV or a database.
You can use schedule or Celery to make it run automatically, like daily at 10:00 AM.
